presh
=====

Presh aims to be the Prestashop Shell, inspired by
[Drush](http://github.com/drush-ops/drush), the Drush Shell for
Drupal, with the goal of ease the automation of many of the tasks that by
default have to be done by a human with the web interface of Prestashop, and as
a consequence, reduce the time needed to setup or maintain an e-commerce web
site based on Prestashop.

Presh will have a command line interface based mainly on PHP and will work on
a [Prestashop](http://www.prestashop.com) installation dealing directly with
its underlying model objects and its configuration.

Many iterations will be needed to evolve Presh to the point where it can
achieve this goal, so every suggestion, improvement and contribution will
be very welcomed!

Envisioned features
===================

- Have a roadmap to guide the development
- Define some kind of convention that Prestashop modules could follow to be
discovered and managed by presh. This convention could also be used to
modularize the composition of presh
- Allow the definition of a full Prestashop site within a single plain text
file; something similar to Drush Make
- Allow modules and/or themes to be downloaded from a given URL or from some
kind of repository (like Subversion, Git or Mercurial)
- Provide functionalities for site and/or database backups/restorations
- Distribute it via some kind of PHP component distribution,
using [PEAR](http://pear.php.net/), [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/),
[Packagist](https://packagist.org/) or some combination of such components
- Have some kind of flexible logging functionality

Usage
=====

- Download presh to some directory, for example ~/presh
- Optionally update the `PATH` environment variable to contain the presh
directory, for example: `export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/presh`
- Go to a directory where a Prestashop is installed
- Execute `presh` with any of its available methods. The general invocation
is like this:

    $ presh <command> [argument1] [argument2] ... [argumentN]
    
- Some examples of using it are:

    $ presh help

    $ presh version

    $ presh update_modules
    
    $ presh update_global_value PS_SHOP_EMAIL new_address@mydomain.com

    $ presh toggle_activation_status

    $ presh activate_shop 0

    $ presh activate_shop 1
    
    $ presh run example_run_file.php 1
    
	$ presh constant \_DB_SERVER\_

- Presh also offers a way to fix Prestashop problems with SSL/TLS mail sending.
It is done through a) the inclusion of a newer version of
[SwiftMailer](http://swiftmailer.org/) than the one used by Prestashop
developers (version 5.x instead of version 3.x) and b) the patching of some
Prestashop core files. It works like these:

    $ presh fix_mail # apply patch and download SwiftMailer 5.x

    $ presh fix_mail false false # no reverse patch, no download of SwiftMailer

    $ presh fix_mail false true # no reverse patch, try to download SwiftMailer

    $ presh fix_mail true # reverse patch (this will cause previously downloaded v5.x of SwiftMailer library to be deleted)

To know which Prestashop versions are patchable this way, see the patch files
in the `fix_mail_encryption/patches` directory and the `$PATCHES` variable
inside the `fix_mail_encryption/fix.php` file.

For mail fixing to work it is asssumed that a newer SwiftMailer library is
located at `tools/swift5/lib`. Versions `5.0.3`, `5.1.0`, `5.2.1` and `5.2.2`
have been used fine. `Presh` internally offers a way to download
[SwiftMailer library from GitHub](http://github.com/swiftmailer/swiftmailer).
